# Versa Protocol Schema
There are broadly two kinds of types represented in this repository: Protocol Bindings and Purchase Details

## Protocol Bindings
Protocol Bindings represent the types of requests, responses, and error codes to be expected when developing client implementations according to the specifications of the Versa Protocol. These types are defined in the `protocol_bindings` directory.

## Purchase Details
Purchase Details represent the receipt and invoice data schemas to be handled  when developing client implementations according to the specifications of the Versa Protocol. These types are defined in the `purchase_details` directory.
